# A-Pathfinding-Visualization-javascript-
This is a path finding visualizer project that uses a* algorithm for searching the shortest path between two nodes.

# The following project uses Javascript State Machine library

this project was an attempt by me to recreate and analyze how the a* algorithm works by reverse engineering the whole pathfinding.js library issued under MIT LISCENCE https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/.
